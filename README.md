This project introduces a Pepper-based social assistant for pharmacies, designed to guide customers through the most common tasks. It can help order medications, check if a prescription is needed, scan barcodes to confirm their validity, and determine whether a fiscal code is required (for the medication itself or for tax deduction purposes). If necessary, it will request the customer's sanitary card and verify that the number matches their identity.
It then checks product availability. If the item is out of stock, the assistant asks the customer whether they want to place an order or opt for a generic alternative. It can also display and read aloud important information, such as side effects, dosage instructions, and potential interactions with other medications.
Finally, the assistant notifies the pharmacist, both to complete the purchase process, deliver the medication, and process payment, and to resolve any issues in the event of an invalid prescription.
